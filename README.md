### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ˜„ My name is Sydroy, I am a graduate Computer Engineering Student at the University of Ottawa located in Ontario, Canada. I like everything around the world of computer and I think coding is one of my way to express myself.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django and working on some project that would be an update to some website that are already available online.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with AI and machine learning because nowadays everything I find on the internet are related to these topics and I did not have too much to study about that in College, so any help would not be refused.

Skills :
- Web Development : HTML | CSS | Javascript | Angular JS | APIs | Node Js | Django 
- Mobile development : Java | XML | Kotlin
- Software Development : Java | Python | C++ | C# | Go
- Version Control : Git/Github
- Databases : PostgreSQL | MariaDB | Firebase

âš¡ Fun fact: I love Tamarind
